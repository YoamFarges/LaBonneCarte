# LaBonneCarte
_A published [**chrome extension**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/la-bonne-carte/oegacpncaonolgbpmphcimodilfoacnl?hl=fr) to display leboncoin's (sort of french craigslist) search results on a map._

Leboncoin is the main website to buy and sell stuff in France, but for some reason, there was no way to display the results of your search directly on a map. Until now üòé

### Disclaimer
- I am not affiliated at all with leboncoin.
- Some sentences of the extension are in french only as the target website is french only.
- The code is just a fun project for me, in order to learn how to make Chrome extensions. It is not in a clean production state, has some known drawbacks, some magic numbers, and has no tests. But eh, it works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
